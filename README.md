# image_data_augmentation

The objective of this code is to artificially expand the dataset through data augmentation, utilizing the Keras Image Generator. The total number of images generated equals the product of the number of batches (6 in this instance) and the number of iterations (30 iterations). It is crucial to ensure that the directories containing the images are located within 'augm', the output directory pre-exists, and the selected image format for this project is PNG.

The project was adapted from a Medium article (https://medium.com/featurepreneur/image-data-augmentation-using-keras-imagedatagenerator-1cee60255ea8) to meet specific requirements.
